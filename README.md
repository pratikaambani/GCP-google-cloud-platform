Cloud Functions is a fully managed node.js execution environment that runs your backend code. For Firebase projects in particular, you can write triggers that execute in response to events that occur within your project. With Cloud Functions, you don’t worry at all about managing instances of servers, or scaling up or down to meet demand. It all happens automatically. It’s intended to be used for small units of work that may be placed under heavy load.

App Engine is far more flexible. You can choose between different runtime environments (Node.js, Java, Ruby, C#, Go, Python, and PHP) and can even provide your own Docker image that provides the runtime you want. You can ssh into the servers for custom code deployment, and you can choose different types of server instances that meet your computational needs. You can throw any amount of computational load at it.
