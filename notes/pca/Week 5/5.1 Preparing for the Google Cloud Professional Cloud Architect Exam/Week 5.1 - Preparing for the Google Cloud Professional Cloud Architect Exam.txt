3.1 Preparing for Business Design
---------------------------------

3.1.1 Reading: Exam Tips #3
-----
Touchstone concepts
A touchstone concept is a complex or key idea -- something that you would learn in a class AFTER you have learned all the basic dependent concepts. They are used in this course because they are a very efficient way for you to learn where you have confidence and where more preparation might be needed.

This approach is based on the Deeper Learning method of adult learning.

Example
People seem to be able to relate well to this example.

Touchstone: "Unlike other vendor clouds, a subnet spans zones, enabling VMs with adjacent IPs to exist in separate zones, making design for availability easier to accomplish since the VMs can share tagged firewall rules."

To understand the above statement, the basic dependent knowledge that must already be understood includes, Regions, Zones, Subnets, IP Addresses, and Firewall Rules.

These basic concepts are not taught or reviewed in this course. They are taught in the training courses in this specialization and in the corresponding learning track in instructor led training.

Advice: Evaluate the dependent basic concepts
Assess your confidence with each touchstone concept as it is presented. Don't expect to be taught the basic concept. If you don't understand the touchstone at all, or if you don't feel confident in your knowledge of it, or if you feel there are specific elements of it that you don't understand or are not confident about -- take note!

This is an area where more preparation can be of benefit for you.

Also -- note where you are confident, know the material, and the dependent concepts on which the touchstone is based. These areas require less preparation for you. So noting what you know well can help make your preparation activities more efficient.
