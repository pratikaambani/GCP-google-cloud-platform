This quest of "Challenge Labs" gives the student preparing for the Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect certification hands-on practice with common business/technology solutions using GCP architectures. Challenge Labs do not provide the "cookbook" steps, but require solutions to be built with minimal guidance, across many GCP technologies. All labs have activity tracking and in order to earn this badge you must score 100% in each lab. This quest is not easy and will put your GCP technology skills to the test. Be aware that while practice with these labs will increase your knowledge and abilities, we recommend additional study, experience, and background in cloud architecture to prepare for this certification.

Infrastructure
Prerequisites:
This Quest expects solid hands-on proficiency with Google Cloud workflows and processes, especially those involving multiple services working together. It is recommended that the student have at least earned a Badge by completing the hands-on labs in the Cloud Architecture Quest before beginning. Additional lab experience with the Google Cloud Solutions I , the Google Cloud Solutions II, and the Kubernetes Solutions Quests will be useful.
