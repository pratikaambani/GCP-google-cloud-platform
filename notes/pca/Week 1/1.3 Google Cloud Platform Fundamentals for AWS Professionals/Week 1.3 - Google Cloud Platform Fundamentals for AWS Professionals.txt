Check status of added instance
	it has internal and external IP - click SSH - ping wikipedia.com - outbound traffic is allows in default network
	ping from local computer to external ip. Works because: ICMP is allowed
	
Create another instance:
	Zone different - create
	ssh and ping internal address of 1st instance
	ssh to 1st instance and ping internal address of 2nd instance
	
	runL: sudo route in ssh of both the instances

| Module 6: Isolating Instances and Apps |
------------------------------------------
In this module we explore the GCP network and learn how you can build custom networks from scratch to meet your needs. You will learn that subnets are administrative tools and they do not inherently separate traffic. You will also learn that GCP networks are a property of projects, but that you can share or peer them or connect them via virtual private networks (VPNs). In the lab you will create a custom network and use firewall rules to create a public frontend and private backend.

* Objectives
